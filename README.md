# [S]imple [J]ava [F]lows

## Motivation
  From my experience in coding java, I have felt that,
  > we write more or less 60% of repetative code on any project. _(The number is purely based on my experience and can go a little high or down for others but overall I believe, we all will agree that we write repetative code)_

  > Another big problem that I faced when joining to an existing project, is to get hold of the different flows that the project has. To understand this either, we need to get a KT from another person or spend a good amount of time and navigate through various classes/methods in the project

  > Last but certainly not the least is debugging - when we deploy our code in a enviromment and some flow breaks. We have to rely on logs that are already present, if they are not sufficient putting further logs and redeploy and replay the flow to identify the issue. I know there is a way of remote-debugging but not every where it can be used (for example if the environment is running behind a firewall) and even in remote-debugging we have to replay the flow to identify the issue.

  I am sure most (if not all) of us has faced these problems some time or the other with an impact of medium to heavy, and this motivated me to for SJF to resolve these problems fully (or as much as possible).

Sounds exciting? If not then apprecieate your time reading till here and have a good day, otherwise let's jump right in to get familiar with the framework ðŸ˜‰

## Key Concepts
Let's kick-off by understanding the key concepts of SJF.

* #### Exectuable\<I, O>
  > A piece of code which can execute. It takes an input of type `I` and produces an output of type `O`. This is a `FunctionalInterface`, hence can be written as `lambda functions`. Now, you may ask that we already have `java.util.function.Function<I, O>` in java and why we need another `FunctionalInterface`? Well, the answer is, we cannot pass unsafe code (i.e. code which can throw `Exception`) directly into a `Function` without handling it but we can do this with an `Executable`. Enough talking, now, let's understand the difference in the below code:
  > ```java
  > class CannotDivideByZeroException extends Exception {...}
  > 
  > //an unsafe method which throws IOException
  > public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) throws CannotDivideByZeroException {
  >   if (divisor == 0) throw new CannotDivideByZeroException();
  >   return divident / divisor;
  > }
  > 
  > //Using Function:
  > Function<Integer, Integer> dividerF = n -> {
  >   int res;
  >   try {
  >     res = divide(n);
  >   } catch (CannotDivideByZeroException ex) {
  >     res = 0;
  >   }
  >   return res;
  > }
  > 
  > //Using Executable:
  > Executable<Integer, Integer> dividerE = n -> divide(n); //or using method reference: this::divide
  > ```
  > In the above example the method `divide` throws a checked exception and to use it in a `Function` we have to wrap it inside `try-catch` and on the other hand we can simply use the unsafe method `divide` with no exception handling using `Executable`.
  > 
  > Ok, the next question is how is the exception handled then in case of using `Executable`? The answer is, at the time of execution i.e. when I am executing the exectuable I need to handle the exception. This makes sense because exception occurs while executing not while defining. Following code explains execution of `Executable` vs `Function`.
  > ```java
  > int a = //user input
  > int b = //user input
  > 
  > //Using Function
  > int res = divididerF.apply(a, b); //We don't know if exception occurred or not (I know we can handle using better design but that will add extra complexity to the simple code)
  > 
  > //Using Executable
  > try {
  >   int res = dividerE.execute(a, b);
  > } catch (Exception ex) {
  >   //Boom, exception occured while exeucuting, we got that information and can handle that here.
  > }
  > ```

* #### Step\<I, O>
  > When we execute an `Executable<I, O>` with an `I`, we get just the result i.e. `O`. We don't have any other way to know how much time it took to execute. (_Yes, we can use startTs and endTs before and after the execution to calculate the time, but as I said earlier, that would be a repetitive code_) Here comes `Step<I, O>`. A Step is nothing but an enhanced version of Executable. We can lift an executable to a step using the `Step.lift(Executable<I, O> x)` method. A step can also be named by using the overloaded `lift` method and passing a name for the step. When we execute a step, we get `ExecutionResult<O>` and from this we can know the result (of type `O` if the execution was successful), error (if the execution failed), and the duration of the execution.

* #### Flow\<I, O>
  > Now that we know about step, would a single step be ever useful? Any complex operation is performed by executing multiple individual steps serially or parallely or mix of both according to the need. `Flow<I, O>` represents a collection of steps i.e. a `Flow<I, O>` is constructed by joining multiple steps that starts by taking `I` as input and ends producing `O` as output. A step can be converted to a flow using the `toFlow()` method of step. A step can be added to a flow using the `<R> then(Step<O, R> next)` method of flow. A step can be added to a flow in various ways which I will describe later in this article. Like step, flow also returns `ExecutionResult<O>` when executed.

* #### ExecutionResult\<O>
  > `ExecutionResult<O>` is produced either by executing a step or a flow. This contains a boolean value informing if the execution was successful, the result (of type `O` if the execution succeeded), error (if the execution failed), and the duration of the execution.

* #### ExecutionEngine
  > We need an engine to execute a step or a flow. This also distinguishes the construction and execution of a flow/step. We can also pass pre-hooks and/or post-hooks in a execution engine which if passed will be executed before executing a step and after executing a step accordingly. Let's see some example code to understand what we saw so far.
  > ```java
  > //Let's construct a sample flow which
  > // calculates the length of a string -> converts to a binary string -> calculates the length -> returns if the length is even
  > Step<String, Integer> lengthStep = Step.lift("length", String::length); // defined a step separately as this is used twice in the following flow.
  > Flow<String, Boolean> sampleFlow = lengthStep.toFlow()
  >         .then("binary", Integer::toBinaryString)
  >         .then(lengthStep)
  >         .then("isEven", l -> l % 2 == 0);
  > 
  > //Execute in default execution engine.
  > ExecutionResult<Boolean> result = ExecutionEngine.defaultEngine().execute(sampleFlow, "Simple Java Flows");
  > System.out.println(result);
  > result.printExecution();
  >

ðŸ’¡ _It is advised to always provide a name to a step. This will increase readability of flow execution log (as shown above in the output section) and help in debugging._
