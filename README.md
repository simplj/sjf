# [S]imple [J]ava [F]lows

## Motivation
  From my experience in coding java, I have felt that,
  > we write more or less 60% of repetative code on any project. _(The number is purely based on my experience and can go a little high or down for others but overall I believe, we all will agree that we write repetative code)_

  > Another big problem that I faced when joining to an existing project, is to get hold of the different flows that the project has. To understand this either, we need to get a KT from another person or spend a good amount of time and navigate through various classes/methods in the project

  > Last but certainly not the least is debugging - when we deploy our code in a enviromment and some flow breaks. We have to rely on logs that are already present, if they are not sufficient putting further logs and redeploy and replay the flow to identify the issue. I know there is a way of remote-debugging but not every where it can be used (for example if the environment is running behind a firewall) and even in remote-debugging we have to replay the flow to identify the issue.

  I am sure most (if not all) of us has faced these problems some time or the other with an impact of medium to heavy, and this motivated me to develop a framework which would resolve these problems fully (or as much as possible). Let's take a quick look at how does it help solving the problems.
  * This framework enables one to construct a business flow (or a feature) simply by configuring individual steps (that are part of the enitre flow) in various way as needed. Thus the name **Simple Java Flows** or **SJF**. This **increases readability** of the flow meaning a new comer can quickly get a overall picture of what the flow is doing just by looking at it's definition
  * When a flow is executed, it returns the execution's context comprising of _a) what was the input for the step, b) how much time the step took and c) whether the step produced an output or threw exception_. This gives an end-to-end knowlwedge of how the flow executed which **eases debugging**.
  * The framework comes with capabilities of performing common operations by itself, enabling developer to focus only on writing the business logic part and thus **gaining individual and team productivity**. The list of **common operations** that SJF offers currently are not exhaustive, because covering all operations which may sound redundant is not a quick work but they are in progress and will be published as a plug-and-play fashion gradually. Nonetheless, the framework already covers quite a few basic operations which will be discussed in the later section, to name a few: retryable step, bookmarking within a flow (helps in writing [idempotent operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)), triggering async step, parallel steps, pausing for a condidtion to satisfy etc.

Sounds exciting? Let's jump right in to get familiar with the framework then ðŸ˜‰

## Key Concepts
Let's kick-off by understanding the key concepts of SJF.

* #### Exectuable\<I, O>
  > A piece of code which can execute. It takes an input of type `I` and produces an output of type `O`. This is a `FunctionalInterface`, hence can be written as `lambda functions`. Now, you may ask that we already have `java.util.function.Function<I, O>` in java and why we need another `FunctionalInterface`? Well, the answer is, we cannot pass unsafe code (i.e. code which can throw `Exception`) directly into a `Function` without handling it but we can do this with an `Executable`. Enough talking, now, let's do some coding to understand the difference:
  > ```java
  > class CannotDivideByZeroException extends Exception {...}
  > 
  > //an unsafe method which throws a checked exception
  > public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) throws CannotDivideByZeroException {
  >   if (divisor == 0) throw new CannotDivideByZeroException();
  >   return divident / divisor;
  > }
  > 
  > //Using Function:
  > Function<Integer, Integer> dividerF = n -> {
  >   int res;
  >   try {
  >     res = divide(n);
  >   } catch (CannotDivideByZeroException ex) {
  >     res = 0;
  >   }
  >   return res;
  > }
  > 
  > //Using Executable:
  > Executable<Integer, Integer> dividerE = n -> divide(n); //or using method reference: this::divide
  > ```
  > In the above example the method `divide` throws a checked exception and to use it in a `Function` we have to wrap it inside `try-catch` and on the other hand we can simply use the unsafe method `divide` with no exception handling using `Executable`.
  > 
  > Okay, the next question could be, how is the exception handled then in case of using `Executable`? The answer is, at the time of execution i.e. when I am executing the exectuable I need to handle the exception. This makes sense because exception occurs while executing not while defining. Following code explains execution of `Executable` vs `Function`.
  > ```java
  > int a = //user input
  > int b = //user input
  > 
  > //Using Function
  > int res = divididerF.apply(a, b); //We don't know if exception occurred or not (I know we can handle using better design but that will add extra complexity to the simple code)
  > 
  > //Using Executable
  > try {
  >   int res = dividerE.execute(a, b);
  > } catch (Exception ex) {
  >   //Boom, exception occured while exeucuting, we got that information and can handle that here.
  > }
  > ```

* #### Step\<I, O>
  > When we execute an `Executable<I, O>` with an `I`, we get just the result i.e. `O`. We don't have any other way to know how much time it took to execute. (_Yes, we can use startTs and endTs before and after the execution to calculate the time, but as I said earlier, that would be a repetitive code_) Here comes `Step<I, O>`. A Step is nothing but an enhanced version of Executable. We can lift an executable to a step using the `Step.lift(Executable<I, O> x)` method. A step can also be named by using the overloaded `lift` method and passing a name for the step. When we execute a step, we get `ExecutionResult<O>` and from this we can know the result (of type `O` if the execution was successful), error (if the execution failed), and the duration of the execution.

* #### Flow\<I, O>
  > Now that we know about step, would a single step be ever useful? Any complex operation is performed by executing multiple individual steps serially or parallely or mix of both according to the need. `Flow<I, O>` represents a collection of steps i.e. a `Flow<I, O>` is constructed by joining multiple steps that starts by taking `I` as input and ends producing `O` as output. A step can be converted to a flow using the `toFlow()` method of step. A step can be added to a flow using the `<R> then(Step<O, R> next)` method of flow. A step can be added to a flow in various ways which I will describe later in this article. Like step, flow also returns `ExecutionResult<O>` when executed.

* #### ExecutionResult\<O>
  > `ExecutionResult<O>` is produced either by executing a step or a flow. This contains a boolean value informing if the execution was successful, the result (of type `O` if the execution succeeded), error (if the execution failed), and the duration of the execution.

* #### ExecutionEngine
  > We need an engine to execute a step or a flow. This also distinguishes the construction and execution of a flow/step. We can also pass pre-hooks and/or post-hooks in a execution engine which if passed will be executed before executing a step and after executing a step accordingly. Let's see some example code to understand what we saw so far.
  > ```java
  > //Let's construct a sample flow which
  > // calculates the length of a string -> converts to a binary string -> calculates the length -> returns if the length is even
  > Step<String, Integer> lengthStep = Step.lift("length", String::length); // defined a step separately as this is used twice in the following flow.
  > Flow<String, Boolean> sampleFlow = lengthStep.toFlow()
  >         .then("binary", Integer::toBinaryString)
  >         .then(lengthStep)
  >         .then("isEven", l -> l % 2 == 0);
  > 
  > //Execute in default execution engine.
  > ExecutionResult<Boolean> result = ExecutionEngine.defaultEngine().execute(sampleFlow, "Simple Java Flows");
  > System.out.println(result);
  > result.printExecution();
  > 
  > /** Output:
  >  * Success[false :: java.lang.Boolean]
  >  * Flow Execution:
  >  * - {main: Simple Java Flows -> Success[false :: java.lang.Boolean] (2ms)}
  >  *   - {length: Simple Java Flows -> 17 (1ms)}
  >  *   - {binary: 17 -> 10001 (0ms)}
  >  *   - {length: 10001 -> 5 (0ms)}
  >  *   - {isEven: 5 -> false (0ms)}
  >  */

  > ExecutionEngine engine = ExecutionEngine.custom()
  >       .addPreHooks((s, i) -> System.out.println(s + ".preHook: " + i))
  >       .addPostHooks(s -> System.out.println(s.name() + ".postHook: " + s))
  >       .getEngine();
  > 
  > //Execute in the custom execuetion engine

  > System.out.println("Result: " + result);
  > result.printExecution();
  > 
  > /** Output:

ðŸ’¡ _It is advised to always provide a name to a step. This will increase readability of flow execution log (as shown above in the output section) and help in debugging._

* #### StepFactory
  > This `factory` class helps to create the various types of step that SJF offers. These steps will be discussed in detail in the later section of this article.

## Various steps and their usages

#### AsyncStep
  This step is used to execute an operation asynchronously. If an instance of `ExecutorService` is passed in, then the execution will happen on a thread from the same `ExecutorService` otherwise a new thread will be spawned to execute the step. There can be 2 ways of performing an asynchronous operation:
  * Fire and Forget Asynchronous Operation: the operation will be executed in a different thread (or in executor if provided) and no way to get the result (if any). Output type of this step will be the same as the input.
  ```java
  public void logEvent(Event event) {
    //event logging code goes here...
  }

  //To use logEvent asynchronously, StepFactory
  StepFactory.asyncStep(x -> logEvent(new EventStep(/*Event Parameters*/)))

  //This can also be used directly within a flow using flow's `async` api.
  Step.lift("first operation", firstOp).toFlow()
    .then("second operation", secondOp)
    .async(x -> logEvent(new Event(/*Event Parameters*/)))
  ```

  * Completable Asynchronous Operation: the operation will be executed in a different thread (or in executor if provided) and the result can be used later in the flow. This step returns a `Completable<O>` object which in turns return a `CompletionResult<O>` instance as result. `CompletionResult<O>` contains information like if the operation timedOut, if the operation was successful, the result if successful and the error if failed. To use the result later, it must be retained by a name and obtained by the same name when needed.
  ```java
  public PersistResult persistLog(LogDetail detail) {
    //actual persisting code goes here...
  }

  //To use logEvent asynchronously, StepFactory
  StepFactory.completableAsyncStep(x -> persistLog(new LogDetail(/*Log Parameters*/))).retainCompletable("logPersistResult").toFlow()
    .then("operation1", op1)
    .then("operation2", op2)
    .obtainCompletable("logPersistResult", PersistResult.class)
    .then(completable -> completable.waitForCompletion(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
  ```

TO BE UPDATED WITH MORE STEPS

## Bonus: Injecting Steps
  > As SJF uses our home grown dependency injection framework [SDF](https://github.com/simplj/sdf), it is possible to inject and run steps/sub-flows dynamically in a flow. This can help running different sub-flows according to the need.
  > For example, we may want to execute a pariticular step for dev environment and another step for all other environments. In this case, we can configure the steps as dependency using `@DependencyProvider` and assign id to the individual steps. Then, we can resolve the step by the corresponding id inside another flow to inject and run different steps in different environment.
